  I love automation and integrate them with modern technology. Create a YAML file, bash, or python script to make it all automated.
  
  DevOps engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I have been obsessed with the idea of using automation pipeline to make developer more fun and easier :)

  Interest with Kubernetes, Helm, Ansible, Terraform, Jenkins, and some applications to make a great pipeline
